# Github user fetcher

This project uses the [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch user data including their 5 latest repos. I've used [Axios](https://github.com/axios) instead of the Fetch API. 

## Usage

Open up this [link](https://warmjuly.github.io/github-user-fetcher/). All you need is your or someone elses github username.
